Use the appropriate journal template (see here for more info); I will use elsevier for this example.\n\nRStudio –&gt; Terminal (bottom left)\nquarto use template quarto-journals/elsevier\nThis will install the extension and create an example qmd file and bibliography that you can use as a starting place for your paper.\nIn yaml at the top of the document, change the format according to the journal article template you wish to use.\n\n\nFor example:\n---\ntitle: \"My Awesome Paper\"\nauthor: \"Me\"\nformat: \n  pdf: default\n  elsevier-pdf:\n    keep-tex: true\n\neditor: visual\n---\nAs you work on your research, document relevant information in this manuscript (which can later be turned into a report, publication, thesis, etc). If for some reason you drop the project for a few years (ahem!), then you can return to this document to see where you left off.\n\nIntroduction: As you review literature, add relevant information to the appropriate paragraph in your introduction, and add citation to References. From the beginning, write in your own works (they need to be clear, but not necessarily well written yet!). If you copy words verbatim, then put in quotes and provide link to reference to be sure you know these are not your own words. The goal is to start putting down relevant information as you come across it– not to write pretty. You can clean up/edit at a later stage.\nReferences: Use Zotero for references (more later!). As you come across literature, put your references in Zotero and cite in your manuscript.\nMethods (Draft): For your initial draft manuscript, explicitly input your entire methods (in excruciating detail!) for future reference. Keep track of changes (and reasons for changes) using Issues in Github. Note to Self: We may want to create a separate RMarkdown for super-detailed methods (with version control?), and then cherry pick from this for our final paper methods.\nResults: Remember, results are just the facts!\nDiscussion: If results are the facts, the discussion can provide more information as to the WHY behind your results (and context!). There is (mostly) a strict demarcation between the two sections. Discussion is where the juicy bits go.\nAcknowledgements: As your research progresses, be sure to add people, funders, etc to your acknowledgements.\n\nThings to remember as you write:\n\nWriting is hard. Do not try to write the perfect words– instead, get the information down. It is much easier to write ideas and then edit them later to make them sound smart than it is to write it all down perfectly the first time.\nIdentify Co-authors: This can be tricky. Everyone approaches this a little differently, but these guidelines can serve as a reasonably standard approach. Discuss early on with your team and as you work with others on your project. If you use guidelines to make your co-author decisions, then this can help alleviate sticky situations related to co-authorship.\nBe consistent in EVERYTHING, including your approach to topics in the Intro/Methods/Results/Discussion.\nDo not use subheadings for each paragraph. If you use subheadings, make sure they are consistent across sections (methods, results, and possibly discussion).\nFollow the rules! (Authors guidelines for your journal)\nGet Help! Do not wait for the final draft before you share with others. Get help early on to minimize time wasted in re-doing work.\n\nFor additional information:\nWriting Science: What makes scientific writing hard and how to make it easier (Kathleen Grogan). https://doi.org/10.1002/bes2.1800\nDefining the Role of Authors and Contributors (ICMJE).

    "section": "",
    "text": "The purpose of this guide is to provide an approach to writing that parallels the path of your research to improve efficiency and allow for reproducible research.\n\nCreate a Github Repository for your research\n\nCreate Repository\nUse Github Desktop to clone to your local computer (store in Documents-&gt;Github)\nOpen project in RStudio (version 2022.07.2 build576 or later)\n\nCreate a draft manuscript using a preferred template in RStudio [This section is in progress-I am currently getting errors!]. Use the appropriate journal template (see here for more info); I will use elsevier for this example.\n\nRStudio –&gt; Terminal (bottom left)\nquarto use template quarto-journals/elsevier\nThis will install the extension and create an example qmd file and bibliography that you can use as a starting place for your paper.\nIn yaml at the top of the document, change the format according to the journal article template you wish to use.\n\n\nFor example:\n---\ntitle: \"My Awesome Paper\"\nauthor: \"Me\"\nformat: \n  pdf: default\n  elsevier-pdf:\n    keep-tex: true\n\neditor: visual\n---\nAs you work on your research, document relevant information in this manuscript (which can later be turned into a report, publication, thesis, etc). If for some reason you drop the project for a few years (ahem!), then you can return to this document to see where you left off.\n\nIntroduction: As you review literature, add relevant information to the appropriate paragraph in your introduction, and add citation to References. From the beginning, write in your own works (they need to be clear, but not necessarily well written yet!). If you copy words verbatim, then put in quotes and provide link to reference to be sure you know these are not your own words. The goal is to start putting down relevant information as you come across it– not to write pretty. You can clean up/edit at a later stage.\nReferences: Use Zotero for references (more later!). As you come across literature, put your references in Zotero and cite in your manuscript.\nMethods (Draft): For your initial draft manuscript, explicitly input your entire methods (in excruciating detail!) for future reference. Keep track of changes (and reasons for changes) using Issues in Github. Note to Self: We may want to create a separate RMarkdown for super-detailed methods (with version control?), and then cherry pick from this for our final paper methods.\nResults: Remember, results are just the facts!\nDiscussion: If results are the facts, the discussion can provide more information as to the WHY behind your results (and context!). There is (mostly) a strict demarcation between the two sections. Discussion is where the juicy bits go.\nAcknowledgements: As your research progresses, be sure to add people, funders, etc to your acknowledgements.\n\nThings to remember as you write:\n\nWriting is hard. Do not try to write the perfect words– instead, get the information down. It is much easier to write ideas and then edit them later to make them sound smart than it is to write it all down perfectly the first time.\nIdentify Co-authors: This can be tricky. Everyone approaches this a little differently, but these guidelines can serve as a reasonably standard approach. Discuss early on with your team and as you work with others on your project. If you use guidelines to make your co-author decisions, then this can help alleviate sticky situations related to co-authorship.\nBe consistent in EVERYTHING, including your approach to topics in the Intro/Methods/Results/Discussion.\nDo not use subheadings for each paragraph. If you use subheadings, make sure they are consistent across sections (methods, results, and possibly discussion).\nFollow the rules! (Authors guidelines for your journal)\nGet Help! Do not wait for the final draft before you share with others. Get help early on to minimize time wasted in re-doing work.\n\nFor additional information:\nWriting Science: What makes scientific writing hard and how to make it easier (Kathleen Grogan). https://doi.org/10.1002/bes2.1800\nDefining the Role of Authors and Contributors (ICMJE).

As an example, we will change the “/content/Hardware.qmd” file. First, read the information in the page to understand the intended content. To start, we will organize different subheadings within this page.\nIdentify Sub-Headings. In this example, we will want to identify different types of Hardware used by our particular lab. In this example, we will want the following categories: “PAM Gliders”, “Drifting Recorders”, “Towed Arrays”, and “Handheld Hydrophones”.\n\nUsing the Source editor, use # to indicate Heading 1 style, ## for Heading 2 Style, etc.\nUsing the Visual editor, use the dropdown menu to select the Heading Style\n\nAdd Content. Most content will consist of text, with some images, hyperlinks, and occasional tables. To start, we recommend identifying the content you would like to put in there, and identify the Point of Contact (POC). As an example, we may put the following text:\nPOC: Jane Doe. General description of Hardware, links to online content (vendor specification page, relevant online content), instructions for build or maintain hardware (or links to that information), links to inventory, etc.\nOnce your outline is developed, fill in the content. IF someone else will collate the content– they can create it in a separate document to be copied/pasted here, or they can directly modify this page.\nIf you find you need separate pages for each sub-heading (instead of one long subheading), then create New Content, and link the new content to the _quarto.yml.\nWhen you are finished modifying your document and Project, push changes to Github using Github Desktop (see instructions here)."

See the instructions below under “GitHub Set-up”. Scroll down to the troubleshooting section if the website is not built by the GitHub Action.\nNote: The GitHub Action installs R so you can render qmd files with R code. You will need to edit to install Python or Julia if your qmd uses those instead. If you have substantial computations, you don’t want to be re-running all the computations for files that didn’t change. Read about the freeze option for this situation. R users with complex reports with dependencies (so qmd B depends on qmd A or data file A) should be aware of the {targets} package which will help you keep track of files that need to be re-rendered due to changes in dependencies.\n\n\n\nClick the green “Use This Template” button to make a repository with this content.
